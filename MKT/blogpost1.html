    <p>I have learned that there is <strong>SO MUCH MORE</strong> to web marketing than I thought beforehand. The amount
        of research done doesn't surprise <br>me all that much but at the same time, it is a lot more time consuming
        than I thought it would be.</p>
    <p>I am stressed out for the made up group so I don't know what will happen to my business once I start creating it.</p>
    <p>I definitely believe that before making a product, you have to be passionate about it. Without the passion, at the first sign of hardship, <br>I can see me dropping the business.</p>
    <p>Learning about google ads was cool, and being able to see how many clicks keywords get is definitely going to be useful.</p>
