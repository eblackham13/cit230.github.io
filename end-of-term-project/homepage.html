        <p class="home-paragraph-1">We believe there is nothing like a river trip for <em>relaxing</em>. That is why
            we subscribe to the
            dry oar philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and
            notice the <strong>beauty</strong> that surrounds the rivers we love.</p>

        <h2 class="home-headline-2">We Run Whitewater for the Rush</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-2">That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all.
            We believe that that
            tenseness that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you
            appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.</p>

            <p>We invite you to come relax with us on one of the amazing rivers we visit. Check out our Trips and
                let us
