    <h1>Reflection: Ranking, Link Building & Google Analytics</h1>
    <p>I felt like this week was easy and enjoyable but also a little like the content went right over my head. I
        understand it in theory but not so much in practice. I am working on that, though! Doing the assignments and
        readings and using my best friend google has also helped my understanding.</p>
    <p>The Google Analytics assignment was really fun. I enjoyed looking through the google analytics site and going
        through the scavenger hunt and learning where everything was, and looking at the information. It made me happy
        that I knew what bounce rate meant and what the analysis was actually saying.</p>
    <p>As a final thought through all of the semester, it is cool to look back and see all that I accomplished and
        learned. I knew where to look to get the answers for the assignment and why they would be under the tabs they
        were under. My knowledge has grown, understanding will come with more practice. I am going to keep my website
        running and hopefully learn even more about web businesses.</p>
