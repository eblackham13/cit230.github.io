    <h1>Reflection: Social Media</h1>
    <p>This week was awesome because I was learning about what I was comfortable with. From the very beginning I set up social media to go along with my business because honestly, that's one of the best ways to get a business going nowadays.</p>
    <p>For my site I have both a Facebook page and an Instagram account. I have seen more success with the Instagram account, but I have a feeling that is because I am more comfortable with Instagram. I have looking into their algorithms and researched when to post and what to post and how to post. I like the way that Instagram has their analytics set up as well. Facebook is a different story. I don't know Facebook as well (I know, I'm a disgrace to my generation). Those who have followed the Facebook page has mostly been family and friends.</p>
    <p>Really, this week was easy for me. I feel like I learned some because it gave me an opportunity to dive deeper into using social media, but I had been doing that from the start.</p>
