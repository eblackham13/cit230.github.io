        <h1>Reflection: Site Builder & Hosting</h1>
    </header>
    <p>What to say about this week. First of all, it was stressful. There were so many options and so many things going
        on that I felt like I couldn't make a right decision because I was so worried about picking the wrong one.</p>
    <p>The videos are helpful, but more importantly they are fun to watch. The enthusiasm that Brother Scott has for
        this class definitely helps me believe that I can actually do this and make it through.</p>
    <p>However, there were many things that stressed me out like no other.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><em>THERE IS NO ONE RIGHT ANSWER</em></strong></li>
        <li>There are literally so many options and choices to make.</li>
        <li>Looking at my finances and deciding on a product was not as easy as it should have been, in my opinion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That being said, I have learned so much this week that I don't think I can accurately describe it all. I feel
        like I am learning line by line and precept upon precept and so those things that I am learning I don't even
        realize that I am learning them.</p>
    <p>Site building I feel I am either going to enjoy immensley or loath depending on if I can have as much control as
        I want, but I am excited to start building my website. I don't have project one completely finished which is
        stressing me out, but that will be done by the end of the weekend. I do know what I want to sell and I have done
        some research myself in surveying friends and having friends survey their friends to see if they would be
        interested in the product I have decided to sell. All in all, it just keeps getting reinforced that there is so
        much more to creating a web business than I thought there was.</p>
