        <h1 class="home">Welcome to Ely and Cait Create!</h1>
        <p>All my life I have struggled with anxiety and depression and chronic illnesses. One of my best friends has
            had a similar life. Between the two of us, we have had over fifteen mental diagnosises throughout our lives.
            When it comes to the phyiscal side, there have been ten. Both of us struggled to find answers to why our
            bodies were not working the way they were supposed to. Doctor after doctor had some solution that didn't
            actually work.</p>
        <p>Why do I say this?</p>
        <p>This site is our way of raising awareness. We both came to love crocheting. It is something
            that can be done in bed when you can't do anything else.</p>
        <p>Quarterly Cait and I will be supporting different outlets of the mental and physical illnesses. Those
            organizations include the following: National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA), Abuse and Incest National
            Network (RAINN), Ehlers-Danlos Society, and the Hormone Health Network.
