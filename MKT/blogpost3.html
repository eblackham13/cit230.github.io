    </header>
    <p>Honestly, I am starting to get super stressed out. I really <em>really</em> want my web business that I create to
        turn into something that works and sells. I'm worried about it not working, and I'm worried that I'm not going
        to get the website done on time and I am just starting to stress a little bit. Make that a lot a bit. </p>
    <p> I am having fun with speculating about the website but putting it dwon on the web and actually making it is
        harder than I thought it would be. I'm a little bit of a perfectionist and tend to be hard on myself. I wish I
        could just create my own website and not have to use a site builder. My major is Web Development and Design and
        I'm feeling a little in over my head</p>
    <p>It might just be that I am tired and had a lot of homework from other classes this week, so I'm trying not to get
        burnt out. I am still way excited to learn because I know it is going to be valuable and even if my store does
        not work, I'm preparing myself to be okay with that.</p>
    <p>Now onto the actual reflection of course material. It was fun looking at the guidelines for site building, but
        looking into the credit card transaction that needs to be plugged into the website is stressful. I don't think I
        want to use PayPal, but I need to do more research and see what other options there are. I found some other
        options but PayPal might be the easiest. And I don't necessarily want to go with what is easiest. I want to go
        with what will be best for my company and give it the highest possibility of success.</p>
