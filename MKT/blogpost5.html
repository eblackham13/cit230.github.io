        <h1>Relevance and Quality Blog Post</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
       <p>What can I say more about Relevance and Quality? It is vital to the ads! Everything that I read this week talked about your ads needing to be relevant so that they have the quality they need to be seen. </p>
       <ul>
           <li>Relevance is the key to having a good quality score.</li>
           <li>Your quality score determines how good Google thinks your ad is, essentially.</li>
           <li>If Google thinks your ad is good, you will eventually be paying less for the ad because you will be getting more money.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Coming up with quality ads is a little more difficult. I am not known for being short on words so coming up with a pitch that would bring in buyers is hard for me when I am given a word limit. Keywords are going to help, but I'm not sure if I have a good understanding of keywords. I get what they are, and I get how to use them, but I don't get how Google scores them. Which I guess is part of why there is competition within the keywords. Keep the formula secret and then you have people paying more and focusing on trying to make their keywords or ads better.</p>
       <p>I'm dubious of how well my ads are going to do, and I'm nervous that that is going to mess with my head. Coming up with quality ads will be a tad more difficult than just making them relevant.</p>
