    <h1>Reflection: Landing Page and SEO</h1>
    <p>Learning the importance of landing page and SEO at the same time is kind of great. It helps to demonstrate that
        the landing page really is important for the best search engine optimization.</p>
    <p>One interesting thing that happened this week happened on instagram. On the instagram account I have for my
        business, mmy roommate and I put up a post about our different chronic illnesses and mental struggles. We had a
        woman reach out to us specifically because one of our goals is to spread awareness for different illnesses. So
        it was really cool to see that happen.</p>
    <p>Going back and connecting this with keywords, in instagram the keywords are the hashtags that are used. Instead
        of spamming our posts with hashtags we are specific with the ones we choose to use. I don't exactly know how,
        but that has been helping the amount of traffic our site is getting.</p>
