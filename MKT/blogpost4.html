    <h1>Reflection: Licenses and Taxes</h1>
    <p>This week was a rough one for me. There was a lot of reading, which normally wouldn't be a problem but this week
        it kicked my butt. I almost got in a really bad car accident and that messed up my mental state for a few days.
        On top of that, I started having problems with anxiety and depression again so it was just a rough week. I got
        my site up, which makes me really happy and I'm super proud of it even though it really isn't anything fancy. I'm 
        satisfied with the work that I got done this week because it was the best that I could do and still be okay mentally.
    </p>
    <p>Reading about legal structures kind of scared me, actually. If I were to have a business that I was super passionate about and thought
        that it would lead to something, I would totally get more professional advise than just reading on the internet for what I should do.
        But at this point, I don't have the time to do that and I know I'm not going to make a huge income off the business that I created.
