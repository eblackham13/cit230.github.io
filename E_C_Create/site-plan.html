        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>All my life I have struggled with anxiety and depression and chronic illnesses. One of my best friends has
            had a similar life. Between the two of us, we have had over fifteen mental diagnosises throughout our lives.
            When it comes to the phyiscal side, there have been ten. Both of us struggled to find answers to why our
            bodies were not working the way they were supposed to. Doctor after doctor had some solution that didn't
            actually work.</p>
        <p>Why do I say this?</p>
        <p>My site that I am building is our way of raising awareness. We both came to love crocheting. It is something
            that can be done in bed when you can't do anything else.</p>
        <p>Quarterly Cait and I will be supporting different outlets of the mental and physical illnesses. Those
            illnesses include the following: Eating Disorders, PTSD, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, and Thyroid Disorders.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The audience for my site is pretty much everyone. Cait and I crochet amigurumi animals ranging from keychain
            size to desktop decoration to stuffed animals. We crochet headbands and scrunchies and make bracelets.
            Everyone is welcome. There is a blog on our site where we talk about our struggles to help raise awareness
            of what we deal with on a daily basis. We want people to know that they can be heard, and seen. It doesn't
            matter what your demographics are, we want you to feel welcome and heard.</p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4 class="heading-font">Heading Font: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif;</h4>
        <p class="heading-font">I felt like this font fit the playfullness of a site where things are handcrafted, but still readable.</p>
        <h4 class="paragraph-font">Paragraph Font:'Open Sans', sans-serif;</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-font">Keeping both fonts as sans-serif helps keep the paragraphs and headers linked together, making for a smoother user interface. </p>
        
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
