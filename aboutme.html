    </p>
    <p>I actually was born in Utah but moved to Arizona when I was just over a year old. For the first half of my childhood I was in Peoria then moved when I was ten to Surprise, AZ. I have three siblings, two older brothers and one younger sister.

    <p>I served my mission in the Ciudad Juarez Mexico Mission, aka the best place on Earth!</p>
    <p>I am majoring in Web Development and Design with and emphasis in Design. I am not sure what I want to do with it quite yet.</p>
    <p>I'm the kind of person that likes to dabble in just about everything. I like to say my superpower is that I am mediocre at everything.</p>
    <p>One of the first things that I am going to do once I graduate and have a place of my own is get a dog. I want a big dog and cannot bring myself to confine the dog to a small apartment that I am currently in.</p>
