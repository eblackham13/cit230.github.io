        <h1>ROI and Optimization Blog Post</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>What I found most interesting this week was watching google show my ads and how people are actually looking at the website that I created. I need to work on making the page or ad more applicable so that I can actually get customers to buy things from my site, but seeing that people are clicking on the ad is somewhat comforting.</p>
<p>Optimizing is what I really need to work on. </p>
<p>This being a blog post/reflection of the week, I think it is fair to talk about COVID-19. It took a toll on me emotionally becuase I had to take care of others who were freaking out due to wrong information being spread. It was hard to prioritize class when I had close friends who were so anxiety stricken they were acting not as themselves.</p>
<p>I feel like I am doing my best in the class and in juggling life, having my own business (what?? that actually happened??), uncertainties about work, about school, about basically everything. But it is hard for me to make comments on a discussion board because I just don't see how that is super relevant to my study of how to create a business. I don't know. Maybe I'm being pessimistic right now.</p>
<p>Anyway. I'm doing good. I've got my site up and running, I'm working on my ads and making them more applicable so I get people who actually want to buy things off of it. Life is chaotic, life is good. I have a nephew that was "supposed" to be born yesterday so I'm looking forward to when he arrives. And now I'm rambling. So I'm going to end my reflection here.</p>
